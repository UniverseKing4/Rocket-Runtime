### 🎵 Dynamic Audio
- 11 thrust sound variations based on speed multiplier
- Harmonic A minor ambient music in Beyond Reality zone
- Constant volume (0.1) for comfortable gameplay

### 🎮 Controls
- **Desktop**: Hold SPACEBAR or MOUSE BUTTON to thrust
- **Mobile**: TAP AND HOLD screen to thrust
- Fully touch-optimized interface

## 🎯 Gameplay

Manage your fuel wisely as you ascend through the cosmos. Collect powerups to boost your thrust and reach incredible speeds. Watch your fuel consumption increase with velocity - strategic timing is key!

**Fuel Rules:**
- No fuel powerups below 100km altitude
- Fuel refills give 10% restoration
- Consumption scales with velocity (1x to 3x)

**Powerup Zones:**
- Below 100km: Thrust powerups only
- 100km - 400B: All standard powerups
- 400B - 2.9T (Asteroid Belt): Speed 10x available
- 2.9T - 7.5T: Ultra and Hyper thrust
- 7.5T+: Quantum thrust (40% chance)

## 🚀 How to Play
